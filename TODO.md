Kvasir TODO
=========

The following list of items are things that need some attention in Kvasir.
These should generally map to Github issues but some may not.

Urgents
--------------

* hosts/edit 'id' field is not hidden in form view!

* clear cache.ram after add/delete/modifies

* Form errors should pop out better (in web2py.js)

* Document server-side filtering for accounts and services in html

* Send a host to be re-scanned and update/replace information

* Long output results should go into an alert div and not response.flash

Needs
--------------

* shodanhq WebAPI calls

* Filter based on IP subnet range needs to be implemented

* Error in AJAX submissions of forms should handle errors... sorta
  handled by web2py javascript.

* Enumerate additional host information using SNMP / SAMBA / banners
  using valkyries

* Kick off aux/exploits to Metasploit / CANVAS using their API

* QualysGuard file parsing and API needs attention. Can use existing
  internal python library to parse XML report. API will require some
  coordination for access to dev/test.

Wants
--------------

* netbios/list is still SQLFORM.grid() .. Usable but not uniform

* Datetime picker needs to be bootstrap-y and not the jQuery one
  Maybe http://tarruda.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/ ?

* Integrate CPE Application database with xml imports and services list

* Like the PowerTables plugin, create a function that will turn a Row()
  or list/dict into JSON output for dataTables or perhaps an SQLTABLE()
  into JSON?

* IP Subnet / Address assignment tables and status. Fields:
  "ip address", "engineer assigned", "scanned/not-scanned", "date/time scanned"

* From IP Subnet / Address table submit to vuln scanner

* Investigage using 'list:reference tablename' instead of reference tables
  for many-to-many relationships. May be easier.

* Quake console integration with JSONRPC API
